the example shown here is one to "farm" volume on a cheap coin in order to reduce the fees. with a simulated 500 USDC, the daily average
volume is ~1.8k and for the timeframe ~32k. This strategy resulted with an ending profit of around $40, max loss of -$17 and max profit around ~$66
and utilizes the floating positions (volume-farmer original does not use this).
